When user selects pending from State field dropdown, then one new field dropdown Sub Status should be displayed below state field, 
which contains value such as: Awaiting moderation, Customer Action, Need Info and Hardware Requested.

solution:
function onLoad() {
   //Type appropriate comment here, and begin script below
 var user = g_user.userName ;
	alert('user name is' +  user);
	g_form.setValue('caller_id',user);
}

    current.update();

 usr.get(this.getParameter('sysparm_user_name'));
   return usr.email.toString();
},
    type: 'getuserEmail'
});

function onChange(control, oldValue, newValue, isLoading, isTemplate) {
    if (isLoading || newValue === '') {
        return;
    }
    var ga = new GlideAjax('getuserEmail');
    ga.addParam('sysparm_name', 'getEmail');
    ga.addParam('sysparm_user_name', g_form.getValue('caller_id'));
    ga.getXML(getResponse);

    function getResponse(response) {
        var email = response.responseXML.documentElement.getAttribute("answer");
        g_form.setValue('u_email', email);

	}
}
